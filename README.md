# Geostats-GUI
GUI to compute 2-D variogram and entrogram

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The variogram is a standard method used to analyze spatial data. Some sources for information about how the variogram is computed and analyzed are the following:

- Pyrcz, M.J., and Deutsch, C.V., 2014, Geostatistical Reservoir Modeling, 2nd Edition, Oxford University Press, New York, p. 448

- Kitanidis, P. (1997). Introduction to Geostatistics: Applications in Hydrogeology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511626166

The entrogram is a new metric that has been proposed as a complemetary method for analyzing spatial data as well by applying concepts from the field of Information Theory. It was originally introduced and proposed in the following literature:

Input file:
              Must be a .mat file containg a 2-D array named "field" that is going to be analyzed.
      
Plot button visualizes the array in the top figure.

Parameters:
              
- X dim. (m) specifies the dimension of each cell in the x-direction in meters (units can really be anything)
- Y dim. (m) specifies the dimension in the y-direction for each cell
              
- /# pts. X identifies the number of points to be used for the variogram calculation in the x-direction; for large fields      using every data point creates excessively high computational times.
- /# pts. Y identifies the number of points to be used for the variogram calculation in the y-direction; for large fields      using every data point creates excessively high computational times.
              
- Distances in X Only restricts the computation of the variogram to distances in the x-dimension only, can be used when there are large scale disparities or there is an interest in looking at directionality of the spatial variance in the field. 
- Distances in Y Only restrictes the computation of the variogram to distances in the y-dimension only.
              
Note: there are some bugs in the entrogram parameters as of 10/15/18.
              
- Y-Scale Factor specifies a number of cells in the y-dimension to expand the moving window for each single cell expansino of the window in the x-direction. Can be used to ensure that the same proportion of the field is being assessed in each dimension as the window size expands. 
- X-Scale Factor provides the same function but in the x-dimension which would be used if there are more cells in the x-direction than the y.
              
- Increase window in X only is intended to limit the window expansion to the x-direction only.
- Increase window in Y only is intended to limit the window expansion to the y-direction only.
